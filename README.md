Card 2:
Name of feature: Card 1,2, and 3

Estimate of time needed to complete: 30 min

Start time: 6pm

Finish time: 930

Actual time needed to complete: I got sucked into the formatting and Bootstrap/CSS for way too long, I should have been more objective focused. - and I forgot to complete this card between card 1, 2, and 3.
